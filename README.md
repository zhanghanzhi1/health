 Core Feature Overview  
1. Health Data Overview
   - Real-time display of weekly averages for sleep, exercise, mental state, and diet  
   - Animated floating bubbles for key metrics visualization  
   - 7-day completion calendar (three status indicators)  

2. Mental Health & Sleep Tracking
   - Five-level mood rating system  
   - Dual recording of sleep duration/quality  
   - Intelligent health analysis with AI-generated suggestions  
   - Multi-dimensional historical line charts  

3. Exercise & Diet Management
   - Tiered exercise duration/intensity logging  
   - Five-dimension diet quality evaluation  
   - Dual-axis exercise-diet correlation charts  
   - Personalized workout recommendations  

4. Personal Goal System
   - Customizable goals for sleep/exercise/diet/mental health  
   - Visual goal tracking cards  
   - Smart goal recommendation library  

5. User Profile Management  
   - Editable avatar/nickname/bio  
   - Local persistent health data storage  
   - Dynamic theme color adaptation  


 Key Implementation Strategies  
1. Dynamic UI Architecture  
   - Built with Jetpack Compose declarative framework  
   - Cross-page data synchronization via state management  
   - Modular design separating data layer (SharedPreferences), business logic, and UI  

2. Data Visualization  
   - Custom Canvas rendering for dynamic charts/bubble diagrams  
   - Physics-based infinite animation system (floating bubbles)  
   - Multi-dimensional data aggregation algorithms (weekly averages)  

3. Intelligent Analysis  
   - Weighted algorithms integrating sleep quality and mental state  
   - Threshold-triggered suggestion engine (Excellent/Good/Warning levels)  
   - Exercise-diet correlation modeling  

4. Local Storage  
   - Layered SharedPreferences architecture  
   - Calendar-driven data queries (7-day rolling window)  
   - Type-safe data conversion mechanisms (Int-to-health state mapping)  

5. Interaction Design  
   - Dynamic button state feedback (press/hover effects)  
   - Guided data entry dialogs  
   - Visual real-time editing system (user profile)  

6. Performance Optimization  
   - Chart rendering caching strategies  
   - Adaptive animation frame rate control  
   - Asynchronous coroutine processing for data loading  

This architecture balances scalability and performance through modular design, enabling intuitive visualization and intelligent analysis of complex health data while ensuring security and usability.
